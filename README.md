# Presentation_Controller
Presentations have proven to be an effective way of communicating the ideas in today’s world. The title of the present project is “Presentation Controller”. In general, the presentations are operated by using a remote or a keyboard. While making presentations, the present project offers an innovative method of operating a presentation. The presentation controller works with the help of one of the recent technologies named Computer Vision. 
When a ppt is being presented, one has to use the keyboard of a laptop or carry the remote while presenting. Instead, we can make use of a presentation controller which is a software equipment but not a physical thing. One can use hand gestures to operate the presentation. This project also allows the user to virtually draw on the presentation by a pointer which also appears as a result of a hand gesture. The user can also delete or undo the previous commands and make changes. This provides an efficient controller which helps the user to operate the slides easily and eliminates the need for a remote or any physical contact. This project is can find tremondous use cases in the market as in any field, the presentations are being used and it will be an effective way to make a presentation. Many features can also be added as further development such as more hand gestures.
